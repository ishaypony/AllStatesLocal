					Some of the common issues with your air conditioner system
				</h2>
				<h4>Warm or Insufficient Air</h4>
				<p>
					Sometimes there are no vents open in a home that make it difficult to cool. Closed vents cause
					issues for air conditioners to keep up and make the house warm.
					A warm house shows that your house's air conditioner is too small to make cooling for you.
					The clogged air filter in your air conditioning system causes you to release less cold air out into
					your house. If your air filters are clogged, it will cause the coils to freeze and impede cold air
					even more!
					Sometimes a low quality or lousy fan or motor will not make your air conditioner unable to release
					cold air. Therefore, it is wise to call for an expert technician to tackle this issue.

			<h4>Water leaks problem</h4>
				<p>
					A clogged condensate drain line might be one of the reasons behind the water leak problems inside
					your house. It causes the water to back up in the front and results in the overflow of water.
					If you ever find water pooling around the unit, it is a sign that the air filter is clogged.
					However, it can be fixed very easily to call an HVAC professional.
					Call Allstate cooling and heating services on 111-111-111 to tackle your issue without much time and
					money spending.

				</p>
				<h4 class="section_header with_icon">AC Fan Issues</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Frozen coils</li>
					<li>Bad fan belts</li>
					<li>Bad capacitors</li>
					<li>Dirt</li>
					<li>Rust</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Sometimes a tripped breaker might cause a fan of your air conditioner to stop working. If you find
					out that your AC breaker is tripped, you call our expert technicians to help you out. Keep in mind
					that a tripped breaker is a sign of your HVAC electrical system.

				<h2 class="section_header with_icon">When your air conditioner won’t turn on</h2>
				<p>
					If the air conditioner is not working, it could be because of thermostat not functioning correctly,
					or the batteries are dead.
					Furthermore, you need to clean the air filters or replace them for proper working.
					Sometimes if the fan relay is stuck, a thermostat short or a bad thermostat can cause your air
					conditioner to stay off.
					If you find your air conditioner system not working at all, you should call us 111-111-11. Our team
					of experienced technicians will come to your place right away.
